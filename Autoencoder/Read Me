This is simple CNN based application which takes low resolution image as input and produce high resolution image. 
This directory contains multiple directories here is description:
images - this directory contains all images that are uploaded during  project run
model - this directory contains all pre-trained weights for model
prediction - this directory will contain the predicted images
static - this directory contain all static material er. images etc
templates - this directory contains HTML webpages.

How to train model

 * To train model install all required libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
 * Open Anaconda and run Jupyter notebook
 * Run Learner_Notebook_Image_Super_Resolution.ipynb file. 
 * Download dataset (dataset link already present in this repo) and set its path into .ipynb file
 * Execute this file and save model.
 
 
 How to run web-based application
 
  * Go to directory flaskapp
  * Intall all libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
  * run command `Python application.py` or `python3 application.py`
  * Now copy ip and port eg 127.0.0.1:5000 and paste it on browser link bar and press enter
